# monkeyplus-go

This repository contains the interpreter and compiler for the programming language **Monkey Plus**. This project is based on the books [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [*Writing a Compiler in Go*](https://compilerbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

> Currently, this project follows the original Monkey language closely as in the books.  
> In the future, additional features and improvements may be added.
